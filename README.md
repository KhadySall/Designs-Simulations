In this repository, I showcase my work in design and simulation, which includes both practical assignments and larger projects. The main software I use for fluid mechanics simulations is STAR-CCM+. 

Our lab sessions typically last between 2 to 4 hours, during which we are tasked with solving the assigned problems and preparing a report to submit at the end of each session. The simulations you will find here were all completed within these time constraints.

For my Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) projects, I have primarily used Python. I completed two major CFD projects during my international semester at Istanbul Technical University, and I plan to work on similar projects in the future using various software, including STAR-CCM+, Python, or other tools.

More projects of this nature will be added this year as I continue to explore different software and methodologies in CFD and design.
